# Discord Archive Bot
[![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/KnightsWhoSayNi0/discordArchiveBot/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/KnightsWhoSayNi0/discordArchiveBot/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

A discord bot designed to quote discord dm exports from the DiscordChatExporter.

CSV files can be generated with this tool: https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter

This bot has been configured for the dm group I originally wrote this for. Change help messages as necessary.

## How to use
The first argument should be your bot token. Place your csv file in the working directory and name it "archive.csv".
The bot will then collect all messages in the archive and you can give commands to the bot.

### DISCLAIMER
